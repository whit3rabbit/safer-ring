- **Tokio runtime** for async examples
- Root or appropriate permissions for some network examples

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Run the comprehensive demo to see all features
cargo run --example safer_ring_demo

# Try the async demo with recommended patterns
cargo run --example async_demo

# Start a high-performance echo server

## üéØ API Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Recommended: OwnedBuffer Pattern

**Always prefer** `OwnedBuffer` and `*_owned` methods in application code:

```rust
// ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED - Works in loops and concurrent scenarios
let buffer = OwnedBuffer::new(vec![0u8; 4096]);
let result = ring.read_owned(fd, buffer, 0).await?;
```

### ‚ùå Not Recommended: PinnedBuffer Pattern

**Avoid** `PinnedBuffer` and methods like `ring.read()` in application code:

```rust
// ‚ùå NOT RECOMMENDED - Lifetime issues in complex scenarios
let buffer = PinnedBuffer::new([0u8; 4096]);
let operation = ring.read(fd, &buffer, 0)?; // Lifetime constraints
```

**Why OwnedBuffer?**
- **Works everywhere**: No lifetime constraints in loops or async contexts
- **Better ergonomics**: Seamless integration with Rust's async ecosystem
- **Memory safety**: Automatic ownership transfer prevents use-after-free
- **Performance**: Optimized hot potato pattern for minimal overhead

## üèÉ Running Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run any example
cargo run --example <example_name>

# Run with arguments (where supported)
cargo run --example file_copy -- source.txt destination.txt
cargo run --example buffer_pool_demo -- --pool-size 100
```

### With Features
```bash
# Enable unstable features (Linux-specific)
cargo run --example async_demo --features unstable

# Run tests including compile-fail safety tests
cargo test compile_fail_tests
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Build all examples
cargo build --examples

# Check examples for errors
cargo check --examples

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint code
cargo clippy --examples
```

## üéõÔ∏è Environment Variables

Some examples support configuration through environment variables:

- `RUST_LOG=debug` - Enable detailed logging
- `SAFER_RING_BACKEND=epoll` - Force epoll backend (testing)
- `SAFER_RING_RING_SIZE=256` - Set ring size

## üîß Platform Support

- **Linux 5.1+**: Full io_uring support with all features
- **Other platforms**: Automatic fallback to epoll/select (reduced performance)
- **Compile-time detection**: Code compiles everywhere, runtime detection handles backend selection
