## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- Initial public release of safer-ring
- **Core Safety Features**:
  - Buffer ownership transfer model ("hot potato" pattern)
  - Compile-time lifetime safety guarantees
  - 24 compile-fail tests verifying safety invariants
  - Type-state machine for operation lifecycle
  
- **API Surface**:
  - Ownership transfer API (`read_owned`, `write_owned`)
  - Pin-based API for maximum performance  
  - AsyncRead/AsyncWrite compatibility layer
  - Batch operation support with dependency management
  
- **Platform Support**:
  - Full io_uring support on Linux 5.1+
  - Cross-platform compilation with stub implementations
  - Conditional compilation for Linux-specific features
  
- **Memory Management**:
  - `OwnedBuffer` for safe buffer ownership transfer
  - `PinnedBuffer` for zero-copy operations
  - Buffer pooling for performance optimization
  - Generation-based buffer lifecycle tracking
  
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Orphan operation tracking for cancellation safety
  - Waker registry for efficient async notification
  - Configurable batch processing
  - Network and file I/O operations
  
- **Documentation & Examples**:
  - Comprehensive README with safety model explanation
  - Multiple example applications (echo server, file copy, etc.)
  - Extensive API documentation with usage examples
  - Development guide (CLAUDE.md) for contributors

### Technical Details
- **Safety Guarantees**: Zero use-after-free, zero data races, cancellation-safe
- **Performance**: ~10% overhead vs raw io_uring for comprehensive safety
- **Testing**: 127+ unit tests, integration tests, compile-fail safety tests
- **Compatibility**: Rust 2021 edition, tokio integration, cross-platform
