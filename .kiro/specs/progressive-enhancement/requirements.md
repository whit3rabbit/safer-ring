# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Progressive Enhancement for safer-ring is a feature detection and fallback system that allows the library to leverage newer kernel capabilities while maintaining compatibility with older systems. The system uses runtime feature detection to determine available io_uring capabilities and provides high-performance implementations for newer kernels with graceful fallbacks for older systems. This approach ensures the library can evolve with the Linux kernel ecosystem while remaining broadly compatible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Runtime Kernel Feature Detection

**User Story:** As a developer deploying safer-ring applications across different Linux environments, I want the library to automatically detect and use the best available kernel features, so that I get optimal performance without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library initializes THEN the system SHALL detect the running kernel version and available io_uring features
2. WHEN feature detection runs THEN the system SHALL probe for specific io_uring opcodes and capabilities available in the current kernel
3. WHEN feature detection completes THEN the system SHALL cache the results to avoid repeated probing
4. IF feature detection fails THEN the system SHALL assume baseline io_uring support and log the detection failure

### Requirement 2: Progressive API Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use newer io_uring features through the same API when available, so that my code automatically benefits from kernel improvements without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN newer kernel features are available THEN the system SHALL use high-performance native implementations
2. WHEN older kernels lack specific features THEN the system SHALL provide functionally equivalent fallback implementations
3. WHEN calling enhanced APIs THEN the system SHALL transparently choose between native and fallback implementations
4. WHEN feature availability changes THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring application restarts

### Requirement 3: Multi-Shot Operation Support

**User Story:** As a developer building high-performance servers, I want to use multi-shot accept operations when available, so that I can accept multiple connections with a single submission for better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Linux 5.19+ is detected THEN the system SHALL support native multi-shot accept operations
2. WHEN multi-shot accept is available THEN the system SHALL provide an accept_multiple() method that uses a single submission
3. WHEN older kernels are detected THEN the system SHALL provide a userspace loop fallback for accept_multiple()
4. WHEN multi-shot operations complete THEN the system SHALL handle multiple completions from a single submission correctly

### Requirement 4: Backend Abstraction for Feature Support

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want a clean abstraction layer for different backend capabilities, so that I can easily add support for new kernel features without breaking existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new kernel features THEN the system SHALL extend the Backend trait with new methods
2. WHEN implementing backend methods THEN the system SHALL provide both io_uring and epoll implementations
3. WHEN a backend doesn't support a feature THEN the system SHALL return a clear UnsupportedFeature error
4. WHEN Ring methods use backend features THEN the system SHALL handle unsupported features gracefully with fallbacks

### Requirement 5: Registered Ring File Descriptor Support

**User Story:** As a performance-focused developer, I want to use registered ring file descriptors when available (Linux 6.3+), so that I can reduce system call overhead for ring operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Linux 6.3+ is detected THEN the system SHALL support registered ring file descriptors
2. WHEN creating a Ring THEN the system SHALL automatically register the ring fd if supported
3. WHEN registered ring fds are available THEN the system SHALL use them for optimized operations
4. WHEN older kernels are detected THEN the system SHALL continue with standard ring operations without registered fds

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Message Ring Operations

**User Story:** As a developer using advanced io_uring features, I want to use MSG_RING operations when available (Linux 6.11+), so that I can achieve better performance for send/receive operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Linux 6.11+ is detected THEN the system SHALL support native sendmsg/recvmsg with MSG_RING
2. WHEN MSG_RING is available THEN the system SHALL use it for send_owned/recv_owned operations
3. WHEN MSG_RING is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to regular send/recv operations
4. WHEN using MSG_RING operations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API surface as regular operations

### Requirement 7: Configuration-Based Feature Control

**User Story:** As a developer with specific performance requirements, I want to explicitly enable or disable certain features, so that I can control which optimizations are used regardless of kernel support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring SaferRingConfig THEN the system SHALL allow explicit enable/disable of progressive enhancement features
2. WHEN a feature is disabled by configuration THEN the system SHALL use fallback implementations even if kernel support is available
3. WHEN a feature is enabled but not supported THEN the system SHALL log a warning and use the fallback
4. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use all available features by default

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Feature Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating safer-ring, I want clear documentation about which features are available on different kernel versions, so that I can understand the performance characteristics of my deployment targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consulting documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a feature matrix showing kernel version requirements
2. WHEN features are used THEN the system SHALL provide examples showing both enhanced and fallback behavior
3. WHEN deploying applications THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on kernel version recommendations
4. WHEN debugging performance THEN the system SHALL provide logging to show which features are active

### Requirement 9: Graceful Degradation Testing

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want comprehensive tests that verify fallback behavior works correctly, so that I can ensure compatibility across different kernel versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include tests that simulate older kernel environments
2. WHEN testing fallbacks THEN the system SHALL verify that fallback implementations produce correct results
3. WHEN testing feature detection THEN the system SHALL verify correct behavior with various kernel version scenarios
4. WHEN testing configuration THEN the system SHALL verify that feature enable/disable flags work correctly

### Requirement 10: Performance Impact Measurement

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to measure the performance impact of progressive enhancement, so that I can understand the benefits of newer kernel features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL measure performance differences between native and fallback implementations
2. WHEN comparing implementations THEN the system SHALL report percentage improvements and absolute timing differences
3. WHEN testing on different kernels THEN the system SHALL provide performance profiles for each feature level
4. WHEN optimizing applications THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on expected performance gains from kernel upgrades
