# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Safer-Ring is a safe Rust wrapper around io_uring that provides zero-cost abstractions while preventing common memory safety issues. The library uses Rust's type system, lifetime management, and pinning to ensure that buffers remain valid during asynchronous I/O operations, eliminating use-after-free bugs and data races that are common with raw io_uring usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory Safety Guarantees

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to use io_uring without worrying about buffer safety issues, so that I can write high-performance async I/O code without memory corruption bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buffer is submitted for an io_uring operation THEN the system SHALL ensure the buffer remains pinned in memory until operation completion
2. WHEN an operation is in flight THEN the system SHALL prevent the buffer from being moved, dropped, or modified
3. IF a user attempts to drop a Ring with operations in flight THEN the system SHALL panic with a clear error message
4. WHEN an operation completes THEN the system SHALL automatically return buffer ownership to the caller

### Requirement 2: Type-Safe Operation Lifecycle

**User Story:** As a developer, I want compile-time guarantees about operation states, so that I cannot accidentally use operations in invalid states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an operation THEN the system SHALL start in a Building state that prevents submission until properly configured
2. WHEN an operation is submitted THEN the system SHALL transition to a Submitted state that prevents resubmission
3. WHEN an operation completes THEN the system SHALL transition to a Completed state that allows result extraction
4. IF a user attempts to use an operation in the wrong state THEN the system SHALL produce a compile-time error

### Requirement 3: Lifetime Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the compiler to enforce that buffers outlive their operations, so that I cannot create dangling pointer bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting an operation with a buffer THEN the system SHALL enforce that the buffer lifetime is at least as long as the ring lifetime
2. IF a buffer would be dropped before its operation completes THEN the system SHALL produce a compile-time error
3. WHEN multiple operations share buffers THEN the system SHALL ensure all operations complete before buffer deallocation
4. WHEN using registered buffers THEN the system SHALL track their lifetime and prevent premature deregistration

### Requirement 4: Async/Await Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using async Rust, I want io_uring operations to integrate seamlessly with async/await, so that I can use them in async functions naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting an operation THEN the system SHALL return a Future that can be awaited
2. WHEN a Future is polled THEN the system SHALL check the completion queue and return Poll::Ready when complete
3. WHEN a Future completes THEN the system SHALL return both the operation result and buffer ownership
4. WHEN a Future is dropped before completion THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the underlying operation

### Requirement 5: Buffer Pool Management

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want to reuse pre-allocated buffers efficiently, so that I can avoid allocation overhead in hot paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a buffer pool THEN the system SHALL pre-allocate and pin all buffers in memory
2. WHEN requesting a buffer from the pool THEN the system SHALL return a pinned buffer if available
3. WHEN a pooled buffer operation completes THEN the system SHALL automatically return the buffer to the pool
4. WHEN the pool is empty THEN the system SHALL return None rather than allocating new buffers

### Requirement 6: File Descriptor Registration

**User Story:** As a developer optimizing I/O performance, I want to register file descriptors and buffers with io_uring, so that I can achieve maximum performance for repeated operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering file descriptors THEN the system SHALL return safe handles that prevent use after unregistration
2. WHEN registering buffers THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain pinned for the registration lifetime
3. WHEN unregistering resources THEN the system SHALL ensure no operations are using them
4. IF an operation attempts to use an unregistered resource THEN the system SHALL produce a compile-time error

### Requirement 7: Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear and actionable error messages, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues in my io_uring code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an io_uring system call fails THEN the system SHALL wrap the error with context about the operation
2. WHEN a safety violation is detected THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message explaining the issue
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL still return buffer ownership to prevent leaks
4. WHEN the ring is in an invalid state THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 8: Zero-Cost Abstractions

**User Story:** As a performance-focused developer, I want safety guarantees without runtime overhead, so that I can use safer-ring in latency-critical applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using safer-ring operations THEN the system SHALL compile to the same assembly as raw io_uring for the core path
2. WHEN safety checks are performed THEN the system SHALL use compile-time mechanisms rather than runtime checks where possible
3. WHEN buffers are managed THEN the system SHALL use zero-copy semantics
4. WHEN operations are batched THEN the system SHALL submit them efficiently without additional overhead

### Requirement 9: Concurrent Operations

**User Story:** As a developer building high-throughput applications, I want to safely manage multiple concurrent operations, so that I can maximize I/O parallelism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple operations are submitted concurrently THEN the system SHALL track each operation independently
2. WHEN operations complete out of order THEN the system SHALL correctly match completions to their operations
3. WHEN the same buffer is used for multiple operations THEN the system SHALL prevent data races through the type system
4. WHEN operations are cancelled THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources

### Requirement 10: Integration Examples

**User Story:** As a developer learning safer-ring, I want comprehensive examples showing common patterns, so that I can understand how to use the library effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building an echo server THEN the system SHALL provide an example showing accept, read, and write operations
2. WHEN performing file operations THEN the system SHALL provide an example showing zero-copy file copying
3. WHEN building HTTPS servers THEN the system SHALL provide an example showing kTLS integration
4. WHEN using buffer pools THEN the system SHALL provide examples showing efficient buffer reuse patterns

### Requirement 11: Comparative Performance Benchmarks

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating safer-ring, I want detailed performance comparisons between safer-ring and raw io_uring implementations, so that I can understand the performance characteristics and overhead of the safety abstractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running comparative benchmarks THEN the system SHALL measure and report file copy performance using existing examples/file_copy.rs as the safer-ring implementation baseline
2. WHEN running network benchmarks THEN the system SHALL measure and report network I/O speeds using existing examples/echo_server_main.rs as the safer-ring implementation baseline
3. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL log the kernel version, timing differences, and throughput comparisons with statistical analysis
4. WHEN performance differences are detected THEN the system SHALL output percentage overhead and absolute timing differences with confidence intervals and significance testing
