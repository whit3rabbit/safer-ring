# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses performance optimizations for the safer-ring library to improve efficiency without compromising safety guarantees. The optimizations focus on reducing computational overhead in hot paths, eliminating redundant code, and improving developer experience through better documentation of threading models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: BatchFuture Polling Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer using batch operations, I want efficient completion matching, so that my high-throughput applications don't suffer from O(N) lookup overhead per completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BatchFuture processes completions THEN the system SHALL use O(1) lookup to match operation IDs to batch indices
2. WHEN multiple operations complete simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without linear searches
3. WHEN the batch size is large THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance regardless of batch size
4. WHEN operations complete out of order THEN the system SHALL still match them correctly with O(1) complexity

### Requirement 2: Buffer Implementation Cleanup

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a single, consistent PinnedBuffer implementation, so that the codebase is easier to maintain and there's no confusion about which implementation to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL use only one PinnedBuffer implementation
2. WHEN developers examine buffer code THEN the system SHALL have no redundant or conflicting implementations
3. WHEN the buffer implementation is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure all modules use the same version
4. WHEN removing temporary files THEN the system SHALL not break existing functionality

### Requirement 3: Threading Model Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating safer-ring, I want clear documentation about the threading model, so that I can use the library correctly in multi-threaded applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading Ring documentation THEN the system SHALL clearly explain that Ring is Send but not Sync
2. WHEN developers use Ring in multi-threaded contexts THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on recommended patterns
3. WHEN RefCell usage causes runtime panics THEN the system SHALL help developers understand why through documentation
4. WHEN designing concurrent applications THEN the system SHALL provide examples of correct usage patterns

### Requirement 4: Performance Regression Prevention

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want optimizations that don't introduce regressions, so that my applications maintain or improve their current performance characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve existing benchmark results
2. WHEN HashMap lookup is introduced THEN the system SHALL not increase memory overhead significantly
3. WHEN code is refactored THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing safety guarantees
4. WHEN documentation is added THEN the system SHALL not impact runtime performance

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user of safer-ring, I want optimizations that don't break my existing code, so that I can upgrade without changing my application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing public API
2. WHEN internal structures change THEN the system SHALL not affect user-facing interfaces
3. WHEN buffer implementations are consolidated THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality
4. WHEN documentation is enhanced THEN the system SHALL not change behavioral contracts
