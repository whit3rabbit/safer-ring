# Safer-Ring

Safer-Ring is a memory-safe Rust wrapper for Linux's `io_uring` that provides zero-cost abstractions while preventing common memory safety issues through compile-time guarantees.

This library's core innovation is an ownership transfer model that transforms the "if it compiles, it might panic" problem of some `io_uring` crates into Rust's standard "if it compiles, it's memory safe" guarantee.

## Core Safety Model: The "Hot Potato" Pattern

The library is built on an ownership transfer model, colloquially known as the "hot potato" pattern. This pattern ensures memory safety by managing buffer ownership explicitly:

1.  Your application provides an `OwnedBuffer` to the `Ring`.
2.  Ownership of the buffer is transferred to the kernel for the duration of the I/O operation.
3.  During this time, your application cannot access the buffer's memory, which is enforced at compile time.
4.  Once the kernel completes the operation, ownership of the buffer is returned to your application along with the result.

This cycle prevents use-after-free errors, data races, and other common memory safety issues associated with completion-based asynchronous I/O, all without incurring runtime overhead.

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, OwnedBuffer};

# async fn doc_example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let ring = Ring::new(32)?;
let buffer = OwnedBuffer::new(1024);

// Give the buffer to the kernel for the read operation.
// When the await completes, we get the buffer back.
let (bytes_read, returned_buffer) = ring.read_owned(0, buffer).await?;

println!("Read {} bytes", bytes_read);

// The returned buffer can be safely reused for the next operation.
let (bytes_written, _final_buffer) = ring.write_owned(1, returned_buffer).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Key Features

-   **Memory Safety**: Compile-time guarantees that buffers outlive their operations, preventing use-after-free bugs.
-   **Cancellation Safety**: Dropped `Future`s are handled gracefully. The underlying I/O operation will complete, and its buffer will be safely managed by an "orphan tracker" to prevent memory leaks.
-   **Type-Safe State Machine**: An internal, type-level state machine prevents invalid operation sequences (e.g., submitting an operation twice) at compile time.
-   **High Performance**: Aims for zero-cost abstractions over raw `io_uring`, with support for batch operations and buffer pooling to minimize syscalls and allocations.
-   **Ergonomic Async API**: Integrates seamlessly with Rust's `async/await` ecosystem and provides compatibility layers for `tokio::io::AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`.
-   **Runtime Detection**: Automatically detects `io_uring` support and can fall back to an `epoll`-based backend where `io_uring` is unavailable or restricted.

## When to Use Safer-Ring

This library is ideal for building high-performance, I/O-bound applications on Linux where memory safety is critical.

**Choose Safer-Ring for:**
-   Network services (web servers, proxies, API gateways).
-   Storage systems (databases, file servers, message queues).
-   Applications requiring high concurrency with predictable latency.
-   Safely migrating existing `tokio`-based applications to `io_uring`.

**Consider alternatives if:**
-   Your application is not primarily I/O-bound.
-   You require support for non-Linux platforms (as `io_uring` is Linux-specific).
-   Absolute maximum performance is required, and you are willing to manage `unsafe` code directly.

## Quick Start

Add `safer-ring` to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
safer-ring = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

Here is a complete example of reading from a file using the recommended `OwnedBuffer` API.

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, OwnedBuffer};
use std::fs::File;
use std::os::unix::io::AsRawFd;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // 1. Create a Ring. It can be shared immutably.
    let ring = Ring::new(32)?;

    // 2. Open a file and get its raw file descriptor.
    let file = File::open("README.md")?;
    let fd = file.as_raw_fd();

    // 3. Create a buffer whose ownership will be transferred.
    let buffer = OwnedBuffer::new(4096);

    // 4. Perform the read operation.
    // Ownership of `buffer` is given to the operation.
    let (bytes_read, returned_buffer) = ring.read_owned(fd, buffer).await?;
    // After `.await`, ownership of the buffer is returned.

    println!("Successfully read {} bytes.", bytes_read);

    // 5. Access the data safely.
    if let Some(guard) = returned_buffer.try_access() {
        let content = std::str::from_utf8(&guard[..bytes_read])?;
        println!("File content starts with: '{}...'", content.lines().next().unwrap_or(""));
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

## API Guide: The `OwnedBuffer` API

The primary and recommended API is based on `OwnedBuffer` and methods with an `_owned` suffix. This API enforces the safe ownership transfer model. For a complete reference, please see `docs/API.md`.

### File I/O

For file I/O, use the `_at_owned` variants, which are ideal for sequential or random-access patterns like file copying.

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, OwnedBuffer};
# use std::os::unix::io::RawFd;
# async fn doc_example(ring: &Ring<'_>, fd: RawFd) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

let mut buffer = OwnedBuffer::new(8192);
let mut offset = 0;

// Read a chunk from the file
let (bytes_read, returned_buffer) = ring.read_at_owned(fd, buffer, offset).await?;
buffer = returned_buffer; // Reclaim ownership to reuse the buffer

// Write that chunk to another file
let (bytes_written, returned_buffer) = ring.write_at_owned(fd, buffer, offset, bytes_read).await?;
buffer = returned_buffer; // Reclaim ownership again
# Ok(())
# }
```

### Batch Operations

For submitting multiple operations with a single syscall, use `Batch` with the `submit_batch_standalone` method. This returns a `Future` that does not hold a mutable borrow of the `Ring`, making it easier to compose with other async operations.

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, Batch, Operation, PinnedBuffer};
use std::future::poll_fn;
# async fn doc_example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
# let mut ring = Ring::new(32)?;
# let mut buffer1 = PinnedBuffer::with_capacity(1024);
# let mut batch = Batch::new();
# batch.add_operation(Operation::read().fd(0).buffer(buffer1.as_mut_slice()))?;

// submit_batch_standalone does not borrow the ring mutably in the future.
let mut batch_future = ring.submit_batch_standalone(batch)?;

// You can still use the ring for other operations here.

// Poll the future by providing the ring when needed.
let batch_result = poll_fn(|cx| {
    batch_future.poll_with_ring(&mut ring, cx)
}).await?;

println!("Batch completed with {} results.", batch_result.results.len());
# Ok(())
# }
```

### Tokio `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` Compatibility

For easy integration with existing code, `safer-ring` provides a compatibility layer. Note that this layer introduces memory copies and has higher overhead than the native `_owned` API.

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, compat::AsyncCompat};
use tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;
# async fn doc_example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
# let ring = Ring::new(32)?;
# let fd = 0;
// Wrap a file descriptor in a Tokio-compatible type
let mut file_reader = ring.file(fd);

let mut buffer = vec![0; 1024];
let bytes_read = file_reader.read(&mut buffer).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

## A Note on the `PinnedBuffer` API

You may see a `PinnedBuffer` type and methods like `read()` or `write()` in the codebase.

**This API is considered educational and is not suitable for practical use.** It suffers from fundamental lifetime constraints in Rust that make it impossible to use in loops or for concurrent operations on the same `Ring` instance. It exists to demonstrate the complexities that the `OwnedBuffer` model successfully solves. For all applications, please use the `OwnedBuffer` API.

## Platform Support

This library is designed for Linux systems that support `io_uring`.

-   **Minimum Kernel**: Linux 5.1
-   **Recommended Kernel**: Linux 5.19+ (for advanced features like multi-shot operations)
-   **Optimal Kernel**: Linux 6.0+ (for the latest performance improvements)

On non-Linux platforms, the library compiles with stub implementations, but creating a `Ring` will return an `Unsupported` error at runtime.

## Getting Started

### Building

```bash
cargo build
```

### Testing

The library includes an extensive test suite, including compile-fail tests that verify safety invariants at compile time.

```bash
cargo test
```
