# Safer-Ring

A memory-safe Rust wrapper around Linux's io_uring that provides zero-cost abstractions while preventing common memory safety issues through compile-time guarantees.

> **üîë Core Innovation**: Transform "if it compiles, it might panic" into Rust's standard "if it compiles, it's memory safe" guarantee through explicit buffer ownership transfer.

## Safety Model: The "Hot Potato" Pattern

The design's key innovation is the **ownership transfer model** (also known as the "hot potato" pattern):

- **You give us the buffer** ‚Üí **Kernel uses it safely** ‚Üí **You get it back when done**
- **Compile-time safety**: Buffers can't be accessed while operations are in-flight
- **Zero runtime overhead**: All safety checks happen at compile time
- **Cancellation safety**: Operations can be safely dropped without use-after-free bugs

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, OwnedBuffer};

async fn safe_read_example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut ring = Ring::new(32)?;
    let buffer = OwnedBuffer::new(1024);
    
    // Give buffer to kernel, get it back when done
    let (bytes_read, buffer) = ring.read_owned(0, buffer).await?;
    
    println!("Read {} bytes: {:?}", bytes_read, &buffer.as_slice()[..bytes_read]);
    // Buffer is safely returned for reuse
    Ok(())
}
```

This approach transforms the "if it compiles, it panics" problem of existing io_uring crates into Rust's standard "if it compiles, it's memory safe" guarantee.


## Key Features

### üîí Memory Safety
- **Compile-time buffer lifetime tracking**: Impossible to access buffers during I/O operations
- **Orphan operation tracking**: Safely handles dropped futures with in-flight operations  
- **No use-after-free**: Buffer ownership is transferred and returned atomically

### üéØ Type Safety  
- **Operation state machine**: Prevents invalid state transitions (submit ‚Üí complete ‚Üí resubmit)
- **24 compile-fail tests**: Verify safety invariants at compile time
- **Builder pattern**: Impossible to create invalid operations

### ‚ö° Performance
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: No runtime overhead compared to raw io_uring
- **Efficient batch operations**: Submit multiple operations in a single syscall
- **Buffer pooling**: Reuse buffers across operations to reduce allocations

### üîÑ Async Integration
- **Native async/await support**: Works seamlessly with tokio and other async runtimes
- **AsyncRead/AsyncWrite compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for existing tokio code
- **Cancellation safety**: Operations can be dropped safely without memory leaks

### üåê Tokio Compatibility  
```rust
use safer_ring::compat::AsyncCompat;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

// Drop-in replacement for tokio File operations
async fn tokio_example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let ring = Ring::new(32)?;
    let mut file = ring.file(fd);
    
    let mut buffer = vec![0u8; 1024];
    let bytes_read = file.read(&mut buffer).await?;
    println!("Read {} bytes", bytes_read);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Platform Support

This library is designed for Linux systems with io_uring support:
- **Minimum**: Linux 5.1 (basic io_uring support)
- **Recommended**: Linux 5.19+ (buffer rings, multi-shot operations)
- **Optimal**: Linux 6.0+ (latest performance improvements)

On non-Linux platforms, the library will compile but `Ring::new()` will return an error.

## API Guide: Two-Tier Approach for Safety and Performance

Safer-ring provides **two distinct APIs** designed for different use cases and expertise levels:

### ü•á **Tier 1: OwnedBuffer API** (Recommended for 99% of users)

The **ownership transfer** approach provides maximum safety and simplicity using the "hot potato" pattern:

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, OwnedBuffer};

// Simple I/O with ownership transfer
let ring = Ring::new(32)?;  // Note: ring doesn't need to be mutable!
let buffer = OwnedBuffer::new(1024);

let (bytes_read, buffer) = ring.read_owned(fd, buffer).await?;
let (bytes_written, buffer) = ring.write_owned(fd, buffer).await?;

// For file operations with positioned I/O
let (bytes_read, buffer) = ring.read_at_owned(fd, buffer, offset).await?;
let (bytes_written, buffer) = ring.write_at_owned(fd, buffer, offset, len).await?;
```

**‚úÖ Benefits:**
- **Compile-time safety**: Impossible to access buffer during I/O operations
- **Simple composition**: Works with `tokio::join!`, `futures::select!`, etc.
- **Memory efficient**: Single buffer can be reused across many operations
- **No lifetime complexity**: Just pass the buffer and get it back
- **Perfect for files**: Positioned I/O methods for file copying and random access

**üìä Performance:** Excellent (often identical to advanced API in practice)

### ü•â **Tier 2: PinnedBuffer API** (‚ö†Ô∏è **FLAWED DESIGN - Educational Only**)

> **üö® CRITICAL WARNING**: This API has fundamental design flaws that make it impractical for real-world use. It exists primarily for educational purposes to demonstrate why certain Rust patterns don't work with io_uring.

The **advanced pinned memory** approach was designed to provide theoretical maximum performance but suffers from insurmountable lifetime constraints:

```rust
use safer_ring::{Ring, PinnedBuffer};

let mut ring = Ring::new(32)?;  // Must be mutable!

// ‚ùå THIS PATTERN DOESN'T WORK - Cannot reuse buffers in loops!
// while condition {
//     let (bytes_read, _) = ring.read_at(fd, buffer.as_mut_slice(), offset)?.await?;
//     // ‚òùÔ∏è Compiler error: cannot borrow ring as mutable more than once
// }

// ‚úÖ Only single operations work:
let mut buffer = PinnedBuffer::with_capacity(1024);
let (bytes_read, _) = ring.read_at(fd, buffer.as_mut_slice(), offset)?.await?;
// Cannot start another operation until this one completes!
```

### üö® **Critical Limitations**

**The PinnedBuffer API cannot be used for practical applications due to fundamental Rust lifetime constraints:**

1. **‚ùå No Buffer Reuse**: The `&'a mut Ring<'a>` signature makes it impossible to reuse buffers across operations in loops
2. **‚ùå Allocation Hell**: Each operation requires creating new PinnedBuffer instances (defeating zero-copy goals)
3. **‚ùå No Loops**: Standard loop patterns fail to compile due to borrow checker conflicts  
4. **‚ùå No Recursion Fix**: Even recursive patterns fail due to persistent lifetime borrows
5. **‚ùå Sequential Only**: `&mut Ring` prevents any concurrent operations on the same Ring instance

**Why This Happens:**
```rust
// The root cause: this signature creates persistent borrows
pub fn read_at<'buf>(&'ring mut self, ...) where 'buf: 'ring
//                    ^^^^^^^^^^^ borrows ring for entire 'ring lifetime
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity Trade-offs:**
- **Lifetime management**: Complex buffer lifetime requirements **that cannot be satisfied in loops**
- **Sequential operations**: `&mut Ring` prevents concurrent operations on same Ring
- **Composition issues**: Cannot use `tokio::join!`, `futures::select!`, or any standard async patterns
- **Allocation overhead**: Requires new buffer allocations for each operation (worse than OwnedBuffer)
- **Expert knowledge required**: Deep understanding of Rust lifetimes and async (but still doesn't work)

**üìä Performance:** Terrible in practice due to constant allocations, significantly worse than OwnedBuffer

### üåê **AsyncRead/AsyncWrite Compatibility** (Migration path)
```rust
use safer_ring::compat::AsyncCompat;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

let ring = Ring::new(32)?;
let mut file = ring.file(fd);

let mut buffer = vec![0u8; 1024];
let bytes_read = file.read(&mut buffer).await?; // Drop-in tokio replacement
```

### üéØ **API Selection Guide**

| Use Case | Recommended API | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| **New applications** | ü•á OwnedBuffer | Simple, safe, excellent performance |
| **File I/O operations** | ü•á OwnedBuffer (`*_at_owned`) | Perfect for positioned reads/writes |
| **Learning io_uring** | ü•á OwnedBuffer | Focus on concepts, not lifetime complexity |
| **Migrating from tokio** | üåê AsyncCompat | Minimal code changes required |
| **Understanding Rust limitations** | ü•â PinnedBuffer | Educational only - shows what NOT to do |
| **Production applications** | ‚ùå **Never PinnedBuffer** | **API is fundamentally broken** |

### üìà **Performance Reality Check**

Based on analysis of the fundamental API constraints:

- **OwnedBuffer reuse**: Excellent performance through efficient buffer reuse
- **PinnedBuffer allocations**: **Terrible performance** due to constant new buffer allocations per operation
- **Memory efficiency**: **OwnedBuffer uses dramatically fewer allocations** since it can reuse the same buffer
- **Development time**: OwnedBuffer saves weeks of debugging lifetime issues that have no solution
- **Maintainability**: OwnedBuffer code is dramatically easier to understand

**The Truth About "Theoretical Performance":**
- PinnedBuffer was supposed to be "zero-copy" but requires copying data out of returned slices anyway
- PinnedBuffer cannot reuse buffers, requiring new allocations for each operation
- OwnedBuffer achieves actual zero-copy through ownership transfer AND enables buffer reuse
- **In practice, PinnedBuffer is consistently slower and uses more memory than OwnedBuffer**

**Bottom line:** Always use OwnedBuffer. PinnedBuffer exists only to demonstrate why this API design doesn't work.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for comprehensive usage examples:

### üéì **Learning Examples**
- **`async_demo.rs`** - Comprehensive async/await patterns and batch operations
- **`safer_ring_demo.rs`** - Core safety features demonstration

### üåê **Network Examples**  
- **`echo_server.rs`** - High-performance TCP echo server

### üìÅ **File I/O Examples**
- **`file_copy.rs`** - **[Recommended]** File copying using OwnedBuffer API (simple & safe)
- **`file_copy_advanced.rs`** - **[‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Only]** Demonstrates PinnedBuffer API limitations and why it doesn't work

### üìä **API Demonstration**
The file copy examples demonstrate why OwnedBuffer is the only practical choice:
- **`file_copy.rs`**: ~50 lines of simple, safe code using OwnedBuffer with excellent performance
- **`file_copy_advanced.rs`**: **DOES NOT COMPILE ON LINUX** - demonstrates PinnedBuffer API limitations (excluded from builds)

**Key Insight**: PinnedBuffer cannot reuse buffers and requires constant allocations, making it both more complex AND slower than OwnedBuffer in practice.

async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let ring = Ring::new(32)?;  // Note: doesn't need to be mutable!
    let buffer = OwnedBuffer::new(1024);
    
    // Safe read with ownership transfer
    let (bytes_read, buffer) = ring.read_owned(fd, buffer).await?;
    println!("Read {} bytes", bytes_read);
    
    // For positioned file I/O (perfect for file copying)
    let (bytes_written, buffer) = ring.write_at_owned(fd, buffer, offset, bytes_read).await?;
    println!("Wrote {} bytes at offset {}", bytes_written, offset);
    
    // Buffer is safely returned and can be reused efficiently
    Ok(())
}
```


## When to Use Safer-Ring

### ‚úÖ Choose Safer-Ring When:
- **Memory safety is critical** - Zero tolerance for use-after-free bugs
- **Integrating with existing tokio code** - AsyncRead/AsyncWrite compatibility
- **Learning io_uring safely** - Comprehensive examples and safety guarantees
- **High-performance async I/O** - Need io_uring performance with Rust safety
- **Batch operations** - Multiple I/O operations per syscall

### ü§î Consider Alternatives When:
- **Maximum raw performance needed** - Direct unsafe io_uring may be faster
- **Stack-allocated buffers required** - Fundamental limitation of completion-based I/O
- **Very simple use cases** - tokio's thread-pool I/O might be sufficient
- **Non-Linux platforms** - io_uring is Linux-specific

### Performance Characteristics
- **~10% overhead vs raw io_uring** for comprehensive safety guarantees
- **Significant improvement vs thread-pool I/O** for high-concurrency workloads
- **Zero runtime overhead** for safety checks (all compile-time)

## Design Philosophy

This library embraces **"if it compiles, it's safe"** over **"if it compiles, it might panic"**. We believe that:

1. **Memory safety should not be optional** in production Rust code
2. **Ownership patterns are powerful** when embraced rather than fought
3. **Compile-time guarantees** are better than runtime checks
4. **Ergonomic APIs** don't require sacrificing safety

The result is an io_uring wrapper that feels natural to Rust developers while providing the performance benefits of completion-based I/O.
